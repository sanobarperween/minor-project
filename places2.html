        <h1>2.Ladakh</h1>
        <p>Are you planning to trip Kashmir? Then never miss to put your footstep at the “Land of High Passes.” Ladakh, the “Adventure Capital of India” is the ideal landmark of adventure enthusiasts due to its unlimited majestic offerings. The name of Ladakh is associated with adventure just like student and school. This culturally rich landmark is located in the “Heaven on Earth” i.e Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Ladakh covers about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km) and contains the Ladakh Range, which is a southeastern extension of the Karakoram Range, and the upper Indus River valley. Ladakh is one of the highest regions of the world. Its natural features consist mainly of high plains and deep valleys. The high plain predominates in the east, diminishing gradually toward the west. In southeastern Ladakh lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes with a uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet (4,100 metres). To the northwest of Rupshu lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region where the people and the cattle remain indoors for much of the year because of the cold. Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, which, flowing northward, joins the Indus River below Leh. In the heart of Ladakh, farther to the north, cultivation by means of manuring and irrigation is practiced by farmers living in valley villages at elevations between about 9,000 and 15,000 feet (2,750 and 4,550 metres). Shepherds tend flocks in the upland valleys that are too high for cultivation. Leh, the most accessible town of Ladakh, is an important trade centre located 160 miles (260 km) east of Srinagar.</p>

Shakti is considered as the main tutelary deity in this great temple where the main incantation is “Moonh Maangi Muradein Poori Karne Wali Mata”. The meaning of this hymn is that the Mata Vaishno Devi satisfies her disciples if prayed in a righteous way. This Goddess is worshiped in many names viz. Mata Rani or Vaishnavi. The four objectives of human life are Righteousness (Dharm), Material Pursuits (Aarth), Contentment (Kaam) and Enlightenment (Moksh).
        </p>
        
        <p>The Appearance of Vaishno Devi to Shridhar and the story of Bhairon Nath
            It is said that Bhairon Nath, a famous Hindu Tantric, saw the young Vaishno Devi at an agricultural fair and fell madly in love with her. Vaishno Devi fled into Trikuta hills to escape his amorous advances, later she assumed the form of Mahakali and cut off his head with her sword in a cave.[2] Professor and author Tracy Pintchman narrates the story as, "About nine hundred years ago Vaishno Devi appeared in the form of young girl and commanded a Brahmin named Shri Dhar from the village Hansali (next to present day Katra) to hold a feast (bhandara) for local people near Bhumika stream. At the time of feast, Bhairon Nath, a disciple of Goraknath, appeared and demanded meat and liquor. But Vaishno Devi told him he would get only vegetarian food, since this was a Brahmin's feast. Seeing her, Bhairon Nath lusted after her. To escape him, she ran away stopping at various places on the trail up the Trikuta mountain. There places are now known as Banganga, Charan Paduka, Adi Kumari —the place where she is said to have remained for nine months in a cave, — and finally at Bhavana, the cave that is now known as her home. There taking the form of Chamundi (a form of Kali), she beheaded Bhairon Nath. His body held at the entrance to the cave, and his head landed further up the mountain at a place where a Bhairon Nath temple is now located.

Betaab Valley lies between the two Himalayan Ranges – Pir Panjal and Zanskar. Archaeological evidence proves the human existence in this region from the Neolithic Age, especially at Burzahom, Bomai and Pahalgam. Betaab Valley – a part of the Kashmir region, was ruled by the Mughals since the 15th Century. In latter part of the 15th century the Turko-Mughal Military General Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat ruled over Kashmir first on behalf of Sultan Said Khan of Kashgar and then on behalf of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Ghiyas-ud-Din Zain-ul-Abidin invaded and ruled Kashmir region for about 40 years during which he was famous for promoting peace and harmony in Kashmir.[citation needed] He even gave a directive to restore and restructure Kashmir during his reign – in sharp contrast to the other plunderers who preceded him.[citation needed]</p>
        <p>Betab Valley is a very popular touristic destination. Betaab Valley is also a favorite campsite of travelers as it also serves as a base camp for trekking and further exploration of the mountains. The valley is a walk-able distance from Pahalgam. The crystal clear & chilly water of the stream bubbling down from the snowy hills is a delight; locals here drink this water too.

        <h1>8. Srinagar</h1>
        <p>Being the summer capital of Kashmir, Srinagar holds an eternal uniqueness to the travel enthusiasts of all over the world. To arrive the panoramic valley of Kashmir, tourists have to stretch out to this gateway. One of the most important tributaries of Indus, the mirror-sheet like Jhelum River welcomes the tourists after reaching the largest city of Kashmir.</p>
           <p>In 1989, Srinagar became the focus of the insurgency against Indian rule. The area continues to be a highly politicised hotbed of separatist activity with frequent spontaneous protests and strikes ("bandhs" in local parlance). On 19 January 1990, the Gawakadal massacre of at least 50 unarmed protestors by Indian forces, and up to 280 by some estimates from eyewitness accounts, 
             set the stage for bomb blasts, shootouts, and curfews that characterised Srinagar throughout the early and mid-1990s.[24][25] As a result, bunkers and checkpoints are found throughout the city, although their numbers have come down in the past few years as militancy has declined. However, frequent protests still occur against Indian rule, such as the 22 August 2008 rally in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri civilians protested against Indian rule in Srinagar. Similar protests took place every summer for the next 4 years. In 2010 alone 120 protesters, many of whom were stone pelters and arsonists, were killed by police and CRPF. Large scale protests were seen following the execution of Afzal Guru in February 2013.In 2016, after the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, there were mass protests in the valley and about 87 protesters were killed by Indian Army, CRPF and police in the 2016 Kashmir unrest.</p>

        <p>After the end of British rule in India, Gulmarg became a part of the independent princely state of Kashmir and Jammu. Pakistan planned an invasion of the state called Operation Gulmarg. One of the routes used by the invading militia of Pathan tribesmen, armed and supported by Pakistani regular troops, passed through the Haji Pir pass and Gulmarg onto the state capital Srinagar. Gulmarg fell to the invading army, but the Indian army led by the 1 Sikh Regiment, which had been airlifted to Srinagar only after the Dogra ruler of the state Maharaja Hari Singh had signed an Instrument of Accession with India on 26 October 1947, successfully defended the outskirts of Srinagar. Thereafter, Indian counterattacks pushed the tribesmen back and many towns including Gulmarg were recaptured.In 1948, Indian Army established a ski school in Gulmarg which later became the High Altitude Warfare School of the Indian army specializing in snow–craft and winter warfare. On 1 January 1949, the war ended under UN supervision and a Ceasefire line (CFL), which was rechristened the Line of Control (LOC) by the Shimla Agreement of 1972, came into being close to Gulmarg.

            After Indian Independence, Indian planners sought to develop a destination for Winter sports in India. The Department of Tourism of the Government of India invited Rudolph Matt, in 1960 to select a suitable location for such purpose. Matt zeroed in on Gulmarg as a suitable location for the development of a winter sports destination in India. In 1968, the Institute of Skiing and Mountaineering was estab </p>
